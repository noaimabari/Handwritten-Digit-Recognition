# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

This was my first project on Kaggle. I used dataset containing images of handwritten digits which was available on kaggle.
I used 2 dimensional convolution layers and max pooling layers to pre process the images in order to find the features to work upon 
and then flattened and passed the data into the dense layers for classification.
This model can achieve an accuracy of 98.5% in just 5 epochs.
